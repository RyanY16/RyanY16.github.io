A game which tests your ability to read kanji characters based off JLPT level. 

## Credits
https://github.com/jamsinclair/open-anki-jlpt-decks - these Anki decks were used to form the questions. They were filtered (to only select kanji compounds) and converted to JSON files. 

https://wanakana.com/ - this was used to allow kana entry and filtering kanji compounds.

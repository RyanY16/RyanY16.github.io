# Japanese Vocabulary Game
A game which tests your ability to read kanji characters based off JLPT level. 

Learning the readings of kanji characters was one of my biggest challenges when learning Japanese, especially when the same characters are used in different compounds. 

For example,

日 -> にち (nichi) or ひ (hi)

日記 -> にっき (nikki)

誕生日 -> たんじょうび (tanjoubi)

Using JLPT levels as a general standard, I created a game to test your ability to read various kanji words and compounds. 

# How to Play

Select a difficulty/time limit and press start game

The kanji word will show up at the top, type the correct reading in the box

If the reading is correct, it will automatically show the next word

To skip, type "?"

Below the input box the kanji, hiragana reading and meaning in English will be displayed

White = correct, read = skipped, blue = unanswered (last question before time runs out)
